# PewPew Live Additional Framework
`PewPew Live Additional Framework` is a set of modules, created to simplify `PewPew Live` level creation. To learn more about `PPLAF` features, check [wiki](https://github.com/glebi574/PPLAF/wiki).  
## Why to use `PPLAF`?
* `PewPew Live`'s customizable entity system isn't convenient, as you have to maintain a lot of stuff yourself. With `PPLAF` you only have to work on entity's AI, graphics, etc. You can concentrate on creating gameplay features instead of maintaining entities.
* Useful frameworks automate routine code and things you always use while creating levels.
* Unique assets, made for `PPLAF`.
# `PPLAF` Features
### `Entity` framework
You don't have to manually create, customize and maintain custom entities anymore. In `PPLAF` you only define types, `PPLAF` maintains everything for you. `Entity` framework has a lot of functionality and can maintain animations, entity's prototypes, etc. `Entity` framework also defines prototypes of pewpew functions to optimize your code.
### `Camera` framework
`Camera` framework maintains camera movement. You can change any parameters you want and set your own function to modify camera movement. That allows you to make scene less static, make players feel every movement they do and create cinematic scenes.
### `Animation` framework
`Animation` framework is part of `Entity` framework. It automatically maintains single-file and multiple-file animations. There are a lot of settings, that allow you to achieve certain behaviour.
